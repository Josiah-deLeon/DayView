Steps: 1. To convert pdf to csv>
                                -*Install java
                                -*Test file conversion
                                -Create a csv file
                                -

    Update: PDF format changed so new parsing required.
    Implemented the pypdf2 module and wasn't getting all the information
    from the pdf. This is because the module directly the text data from the
    pdf which in this case is an image. Since it's a scanned image
    ideally an OCR(optical character recoginition) solution would work better
